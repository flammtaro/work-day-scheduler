# work-day-scheduler

## Description
- The goal of this project was to create a web page consisting of a current date/time indicator at the top, and a list of editable text fields for different time slots that will update their color based on the corresponding real-world time (past, present, future)

- I built this project in order to better understand how to implement web API's like MomentJS and Bootstrap. I used this tools in order to populate the realtime time/date elements, and to create the flexible text field inputs

- What I learned on this project is that creating a long list of the similar elements can get tedious when not put into a structured for-loop. I plan on updating this to include said for loops in the near future, and include them on future projects
